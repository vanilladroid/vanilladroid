Hi, I’m Mihaita Braes 👋

I’ve always been drawn to where technology meets creativity.
I studied Electronics Engineering, spent the last five years in Product Management (mostly Fintech and SaaS), and now I’m rekindling my technical side through web development.

🎯 What I’m Doing Here

Learning modern full-stack development with a focus on frontend and visual design.
I love building interfaces that feel intuitive and look beautiful — it’s where my technical and artistic sides overlap.

Current Focus:

•	⚛️ React and JavaScript

•	🎨 Tailwind CSS for styling that brings interfaces to life

•	🧩 Full-stack architecture — understanding how systems work end-to-end

•	🌌 Three.js for rich, interactive visual experiences

🧠 What You’ll Find

Personal projects, learning experiments, and whatever I’m curious about at the moment.
First project: a family budgeting app that doesn’t make you want to close it immediately.

💬 This is my learning journal, not a portfolio.
Everything here is a work in progress.
